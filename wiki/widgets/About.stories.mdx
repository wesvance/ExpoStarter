# About Common Components

Found at `src/components/atoms`

Our common components are the smallest react components, equivalent to [atoms](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#:~:text=Atomic%20design%20is%20atoms%2C%20molecules,parts%20at%20the%20same%20time.) in the Atomic Design methodology.
They should not have any connection to global state, can only depend on utilities, and state
must be passed into the components via props.

Common components follow the _[module format]()_
